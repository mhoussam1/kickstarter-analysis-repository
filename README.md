## Overview of Project
Background: Louiseâ€™s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset we will visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. This is a written report based on the analysis and the visualizations created.

### Purpose

Deliverable 1: Outcomes Based on Launch Date Chart.
Deliverable 2: Outcomes Based on Goals Chart 
Deliverable 3: A written analysis of the results. 


## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The analysis for outcomes based on the launch date can be shown on the line graph to show that it was separated into 3 different points, successful, failed and canceled. Then using the axis of the different months of the year. As shown on the graph. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The analysis of the outcomes based on goals, it was linked to the percentage and using all the different plays. As shown on the graph.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
There were no difficulties encountered in this challenge, the only point that I would say would need extra attention and to focus on. Is when writing the formulas for the find it make sure you are using the right numbers and the right symbols to show the range for each part. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

For the month of May you can see that the successful campaigns launched compared to the goal set. While for the lowest campaigns launched were in December.
The second conclusion to be drawn out is that the time of the year has no correlation with the theater being canceled or failing. Other factors are what make the difference. 


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
From the graph we are able to see that the campaigns with goals less then 20k and between 35-45k have a higher percentage of successful campaigns while campaigns with goals greater then 45k or between 20-35k showed a higher percentage of failed campaigns. There was no record of any canceled campaigns therefore it was not shown on the graph. 


- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The biggest thing that I would talk about for this database is that the number of the budgets and the profits are in different currencies. The other information that was not added that would help in getting more reasons and to separate the graphs more. if the genres were added for the plays. More results could also help narrow a correlation in the results.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

For every database you could use a couple of different graphs that would help show results and to help with the analysis. I think for this challenge a stacked column graph would be used to show a comparison of the outcomes based on the goals set. Another graph would be showing the percentage of success on a bar graph looking at the different months and using the countries which could help get a better understanding and analysis.
